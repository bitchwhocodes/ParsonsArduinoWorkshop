## Description
A five day workshop split between Unity development and Arduino over the course of a week. This workshop will teach the basics of Unity in the context of game development and hardware such as the Arduino to combine the two to explore the concept of connected experiences. 

## Goals 
Expose students to Unity and Arduino who will have little to no prior knowledge. Understand how software and hardware can be married in interesting ways.  Complete a finished game that they have customized that allows for external input such as a touch pad / joystick etc, or output - such as led indicators. 

## Learning Path
Starting at the basics of Arduino, from reading resitors, writing a sketch, all the way to using Node.js with Arduino to create more complex and evolved experiences utilzing an api and modules that handle serial communication. 

## Arduino
For this session we will be working with the Arduino Uno. ![Arduino Uno ](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TK5QmjGRFa0/VOmQmyTYsuI/AAAAAAAAOW0/CFeUCjRsuK8/s1600/arduino_uno_large.png)
